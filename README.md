# image-lambda

### read this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html) to solve the lab cuz i really dont know theres alot of new stuff in this lab and we didnt have that much for experince 

### what i understant is that we have to read and write from a json file called image.json but where i should create it alot of qustions in my head 

### so i read that article i find it very close to what the lab ask us to do
